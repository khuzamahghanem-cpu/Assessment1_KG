### * ERD
The Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the structure of the database, including all tables and the relationships between them.

### * Pseudocode 
The file Pseudocode.txt includes the pseudocode outlining the steps required to create each database table according to the ERD.

## Hospitals_Database
The file Hospitals_Database.sql contains the SQL commands used to create the following tables:
<ul>
      <li>Hospitals</li>
      <li>Doctors And Patients</li>
      <li>Prescriptions</li>
</ul>
These tables are built based on the structure defined in the ERD and populated using the data provided.

## SQL Queries 
This section of the project includes SQL queries used to extract information from the database. The queries perform the following tasks:
>
1. Display all doctors working at a specific hospital.
>
2. List all prescriptions for a specific patient, ordered by date.
>
3. Show all prescriptions issued by a particular doctor.
>
4. Add a new patient and register them with a chosen doctor.
>
5. Identify the doctor who has issued the highest number of prescriptions.
>
6. List all doctors working in the hospital with the largest capacity (based on the number of beds).
